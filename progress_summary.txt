# Project Ascend: Progress Summary

This document provides a brief summary of the development progress for the "Ascend" application.

## Key Achievements:

### 1. Project Initialization and Planning
- The project structure was set up with a `frontend` (React) and a `backend` (Node.js/Express) directory.
- A to-do list was created to track the development progress and ensure all tasks are completed.

### 2. Backend Enhancements
- **Database Migration:** The initial file-based database (`db.json`) was replaced with a more robust SQLite database using the Sequelize ORM. This provides a more scalable and reliable data storage solution.
- **API Development:** The backend provides a RESTful API for user authentication (signup and login) and user data management.
- **Testing:** A comprehensive test suite was created for the backend using Jest and Supertest, ensuring the reliability of the API endpoints.

### 3. Frontend Development and UI/UX Refactoring
- **UI Framework:** The entire frontend was refactored from plain CSS to use the Material-UI component library. This gives the application a modern, professional, and consistent look and feel.
- **Dashboard and Layout:** A new dashboard layout with a persistent sidebar for navigation and a top app bar was implemented. This improves the user experience and provides a more organized structure.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The frontend is built with a component-based architecture, making the code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
- **Routing:** The routing was refactored to use `react-router-dom` v6, with a clear separation between public and protected routes.

### 4. Feature Implementation and Enhancements
- **User Profile Page:** A user profile page was created to display user information, including username, level, XP, and workout streak.
- **Workout History:** The workout history was moved from the dashboard to the profile page for a more logical user flow.
- **Workout Logging:** The "Log New Workout" feature was enhanced to display the details of the selected exercise (type, reps, duration).
- **Expanded Exercise List:** The default list of exercises was expanded to include a wider variety of strength, cardio, and core workouts.

### 5. Bug Fixing and Stability
- **Deployment-Related Fixes:** Several issues related to production builds and environment-specific errors were resolved.
- **Blank Screen Issue:** A persistent blank screen issue was debugged and fixed. The root cause was a combination of incorrect import paths for ES modules and a rendering issue with Material-UI icons.

## Current Status:

The "Ascend" application is currently a fully functional prototype with a modern UI, a robust backend, and a comprehensive test suite. The application is ready for further feature development and deployment.
